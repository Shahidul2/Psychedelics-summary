”he tells me that i did and i giggle. when we are both done, i climb into the tub in the dark to take a bath. the jungle's back. he joins me for a little bit and we talk. i tell him that i want to be one with him and live as one creature, he tells me that it could not work because we are meant to be separate. somehow, this goes on to us talking about how men and women are the same, just with sex organs placed differently. he leaves me. i close my eyes and colors and geometric patterns swirl. they move when i move my head. when i get out, we lay down on the floor together and i cannot stop moving. i am dancing, but laying down. we talk like we have not talked in years. we talk like we have not talked in years. we discuss the world, ourselves, the things we are seeing. we are open. i tell him that i wish everyone could feel like we feel now because then they would all see the world how it was meant to be seen. no rules, no boundaries, no wars over petty things. if they could feel this kind of peace in the world, everyone would realize just how meaningless everything else is. the money, the nice clothes and expensive cars are all just distractions. my former self tells me something that i tell my spouse: “sink your claws into a tree and climb it. i love that feeling because that is life. ”i am happy and at peace with myself finally. he is having a similar experience with who he is been and who he is now. at one point, i hear laughter and my god is there. being the smart-ass that he always has been, he asks me if i am going to stop being his and go become a tree-hugging hippy. my spouse and i laugh at this for about a good solid two minutes. he goes away, still laughing at us, but in good spirits. the rest of the night was just a solid body buzz that i never wanted to end. we make love again and he has a full-body tantric orgasm. he does get sick towards the end, but he is experienced at this. i only felt a little sick, but nothing came out either end. the body buzz lasts for about an hour and a half and we drift off to sleep. waking up, i feel tired, but happier than i have in years. i have been struggling with depression for well over 10 years. i have had therapy and medication and none of that has worked. one night with these beauties and i wake up without feeling that depression. now, i am not saying that mushrooms are an instant cure for depression, but what i am saying is that they helped me thus far. will i do it again? most certainly and always with respect.\""

       "'i am not sure if i was bored or just looking for something introspective to do, but it was a friday night and i watched the bag of dried shrooms sit on my desk, as if they were waiting for me. i ate a few of them, thankfully they were not crushed or anything. i ate probably a gram or two and let it simmer, i like to do that so i can keep my doses low and see how my mind reacts to it, and if everything checks out, i take the plunge and consume a bit more. i was alone in my room, with nothing to do but to experience things phenomenologically, if that even makes sense. nothing changed quite yet, so i decided to eat about 2 more grams and put on some music. i have a song on my playlist, called pum pum shruum styar . it was quite the song, and i notice my hands become really “handsy”. my hands were indeed, hands. i decide that is crazy and decide to get under the covers and really turn up the volume on my headphones. gatorade by yung lean was after a couple of other relaxing hits. gatorade by yung lean has these synths that sound very wavy sober, and they felt incredibly wavy tripping. each drone of the synth brought upon another wave of euphoria, and i could physically see each and every wave coming from my toes to my head. it was so beautiful and euphoric, and as much as i hate to admit it, i noticed i had climaxed from that song. it was certainly an experience. shocked by that seemingly out of nowhere orgasm, i turned the lights to as dim as they could be and observe my artwork i have up on my wall. i have those light changing leds and a lamp with 3 color changing bulbs. everything was a dim glow, red green and blue, and jesus murphy it was beautiful. i could see every imperfection in one of my drawings start to dance and become something new, almost as if my mind was attempting to fix my mistakes. it felt awesome, i gained insight into new ideas and envisioned an end product much richer than i could have ever come up with. my moment with my wall ended as i got a snapchat from one of my friends. i briefly explained to her that i was on the same level as the gods when i suddenly noticed the leds in my room. they were dim, so i could see each and every individual led. each of them had a consciousness, but they were all in perfect unity, trying to communicate to me that i was one of them. i could see each and every individual led. each of them had a consciousness, but they were all in perfect unity, trying to communicate to me that i was one of them. after hearing many useful wisdoms that i could not for the life of me remember, i looked down to my desk, which was looking very desk-likewhen sudden streams of blue light came from each line of the object, and they continued into a grid like pattern extending onto infinity. the wall behind it did some weird stuff to me, such as be very loud, sort of like a big woaahaha sound as it became all of my field of view, until i heard a pop in my head, when it suddenly returned back to the place it was supposed to be. it is almost as if spacetime and my perception of it is a line in my sober life, but on these mushrooms it became more of a 3d object and was somehow tying a knot into itself, and that pop was the knot coming completely undone, like untying my shoes. that little air bubble in the engine that is my consciousness really scared the fuck out of me, so i decided to turn on the tv and lights. i put on netflix’s our planet series, and watched the animals do what they do. it was incredibly calming, constantly reminding myself that i am literally the same thing as these flamingos are. that thought train went rolling, as i realized my dresser was looking out of place. frustrated, i would try to imagine what my room would feel like with no dresser at all, until i came to the realization that the dresser is as much of the room as the room itself is, and that the room was as much of the house as the house was, the house as much as the town, etc etc until it came to the point that the damn dresser was essentially the universe, and i was at the center of it. being at the center of the universe put my body into a weird place, because i was suddenly not in my body anymore. the whole concept of i did not really apply anymore. i was looking at that guy in awe, sort of like i was watching that guy like he was an act in the our planet show. i realized that his problems that he is going through right now really do not matter, because it does not apply to i. i experienced the blue waves, the center of the universe and exploring the depths of the unknown, and it seemed preposterous that guy was worried about whatever stupid homework assignment he did not get done. this was incredibly blissful, and i became something greater than myself, almost as if i really had joined the red lights council that i communicated with earlier. suddenly, david attenburough is commentating about a glacier, which a massive chunk splits off and roars into the sea. this immediately connected me with that guy once again, and i was resurrected from the dead. the weird thing about that whole ego dissolution thing, if one could call it that, is that i could still see that guy do stuff. like he got up and walked around for a bit, attentively watching the tv. i certainly did not do that. however it happened, i was suddenly reconnected with my body and realized that i started my comedown. i decided the floor was the best place to be and i got onto the carpet, holding onto the visuals i have left. snowflakes were dancing across the carpet, doing funny stuff until i noticed the snowflakes started bleeding, only to realize that i was bleeding. i was having a nosebleed, which is not uncommon for me to randomly happen, it was incredibly dry and i live at high altitude. i was freaked out for a bit, as i did not want to make a mess, but after that was handled i stared at my blood filled napkin for probably too long. i felt really humbled and back to the ground as a human being, i could visually see the aspect of my physical body that kept me alive. from there nothing significant happened, i just crawled into bed and cruised the comedown on my phone. this was an incredible trip that i will never forget.'"
